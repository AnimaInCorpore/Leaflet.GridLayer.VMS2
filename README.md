# Synopsis
`Leaflet.Gridlayer.VMS2` is a _LOCR VMS2_ [Leaflet GridLayer](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#gridlayer) extension for the [Leaflet Javascript library for interactive maps](https://leafletjs.com/). _LOCR VMS2_ is an abbreviation for _LOCR VectorMapServer2_. 

The extension uses tiled vector data processed from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [Blue Marble Next Generation/SRTM, NASA](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/) to show and create print quality images of individually styled maps. Also [custom data](https://github.com/locr-company/Leaflet.GridLayer.VMS2/wiki#custom-data) can be added to the map as well. Tiles and images will be rendered on the client machine so that there's almost no limit in map styling possibilities.

The _LOCR VMS2_ focuses on flexibility, high resolution image generation and the [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) technique.
